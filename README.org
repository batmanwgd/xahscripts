* The Misc Scripts of a Effete Hotshot

Xah's misc scripts. They are accumulated over the years. Some dates back to 1998.

Most are one-time-use-throw-away scripts, for managing my website. Most are trivial. Few are few hundred lines. Vast majority are text processing.

There are {perl, python, emacs lisp} scripts. Language used changed over the years.
